The idea draws from the popular notion of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)â€“ an expanding web of personal thoughts intertwined with related bits of information. Notes and projects are created, then updated and tended as they grow. 

A good example is [[An inspiration garden|my inspiration garden]].

Notes can also link to other notes. At the bottom of each note there is a list of notes that link to the currently open note.

If you would like to recreate something similar, you can achieve similar results using the free, open-source template from Maxime Vaillancourt <a href= "https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template">available on GitHub</a>.
