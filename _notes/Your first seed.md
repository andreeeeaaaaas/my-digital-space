## What on earth is a digital space?

I like to think of this space as a reclamation of my own plot on the internet. 

The idea draws from the popular notion of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)â€“ an everexpanding plexus of personal thoughts intertwined with related bits of information. Notes are created, then updated and tended as they grow. 

Notes can also link to other notes. At the bottom of each note there is a list of notes that link to the currently open note, as well as an interactive graph connecting them together.

<p style="padding: 2em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 8px;">If you would like to recreate something similar, you can achieve similar results using the free, open-source template from Maxime Vaillancourt <a href= "https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template">available on GitHub</a>
