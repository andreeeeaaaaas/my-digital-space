## What on earth is a digital space?

I like to think of this space as a reclamation of my own plot on the internet. 

The idea draws from the popular notion of a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)– an everexpanding plexus of personal thoughts intertwined with related bits of information. Notes are created, then updated and tended as they grow. A good example is [[Inspiration garden|my inspiration garden]].

Notes can also link to other notes. At the bottom of each note there is a list of notes that link to the currently open note, as well as an interactive graph connecting them together.

<p style="padding: 2em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 8px;">If you would like to recreate something similar, you can achieve similar results using the free, open-source template from Maxime Vaillancourt <a href= "https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template">available on GitHub</a>
