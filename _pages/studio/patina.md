While overseas travelling, I was asked to prepare a mix that would air live on the Patina show, on FBI radio. 

<p class ="callout">'The show draws influence from the oxidation of copper and bronze metals, and bridging the gap between the natural and industrial. We invite contributors to reflect on the passing of time and the interplay between decay and regeneration.' – Galiba & Lenna</p>

I tried to reflect these ideas in the context of love; the arguments, the joys, the tears, and ultimately the growing together that happens through it all. Clear acoustic and vocal elements slowly dissipate and smudge into images of themselves, blurred into ambient wash.

Coincidentally, there is a call response throughout the mix that I thought quite beautiful. The soulful pangs of Connie Converse and our mystery woman in [Nate Scheible’s Fairfax](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/nate-scheible-fairfax-interview) talk of a love lost, or not yet delivered. Finally, the meditative voice of Paul St. Hilaire cradles us home with his swooning lyrics in ‘Little Angel’. 

	You can make my soul so right,
	Oh believe me you got me this way.
	In your loving arms at last,
	and your wish is mine. 
	
	If I say your love is really magic,
	And if I say your love is like medicine. 
	If I say your love is my destiny,
	You’re my destiny.
	
	Little Angel love,
	Brighten up the day. 
	Little Angel love,
	Brighten up the way.
