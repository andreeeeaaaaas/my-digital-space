Eli is a physical device that promotes interactions within the online classroom by gamifying the experience. For our user– young students studying from home– eli lets them connect and interact a digital, non-disruptive way. 

In combination with an online teacher portal with engagement metrics, Eli facilitates  support for students suffering from feelings of isolation and disconnectedness in remote learning environments.

## Context

Challenged by the design brief 'designing smarter and more accessible engagement,' we asked ourselves– how might we design digital tools that give underrepresented community members a meaningful voice in their own decision making?

Eli was created during the COVID lockdown in 2021, our group primarily working online and from home. Part of the [Interactive Product Design Studio](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/DECO3200) at the University of Sydney.

## Process

<p class="callout">To understand the process in more detail please <a href="https://www.notion.so/prib/Documentation-04a01715106440e998899726aa308521?pvs=4">visit our documentation</a></p>
### Discover and define
We sought to understand our user through research to uncover user sentiment, common experiences, and future desires.

Our process followed the often taught, rarely implemented Think → Make → Break → Repeat approach. With a 12 week semester already affected by the COVID lockdown, we set out a research methodology that spanned methods such as:
- background research, 
- interviews, 
- questionnaires, 
- competitor analysis, 
- affinity diagramming,
- and empathy mapping.

Combined, these methods uncovered a few things:

1. the feedback loop between teacher and student in an in-person classroom is harder to achieve online,
2. existing products facilitate distance learning, but not online engagement,
3. videos and practice modules are time, cost, and effort saving, but relegate the purpose of the teacher,
4. targeted digital accessories and products (Zoom, noise-cancelling headphones) are the most helpful for students, rather than all encompassing learning solutions (Moodle, Edrolo).

<p class="callout">"So while students were perhaps logged in, they were still disconnected" </p>

### Develop

Based off this we came up with four concepts. In the interest of your time (and mine), I'll focus on the one we chose and why.

## Solution

Eli is created for two primary users: the teacher, and the student.  
  
**For students**, they are guided through a tailored onboarding to set-up their engagement interface in a way that feels personal to them, and can represent them online. 

**For the teacher**, they have access to a desktop-based dashboard that gives them valuable insights into how students are connecting with each other, and with their lessons.
