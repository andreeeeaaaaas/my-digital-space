Challenged by the design brief 'designing smarter and more accessible engagement,' we asked ourselves– how might we design digital tools that give underrepresented community members a meaningful voice in their own decision making?

Our engagement learning interface, aka Eli, is a physical device that promotes interactions within the online classroom by gamifying the experience. For our user– young students studying from home– eli lets them connect and interact a digital, non-disruptive way. 

In combination with an online teacher portal with engagement metrics, Eli facilitates  support for students suffering from feelings of isolation and disconnectedness in remote learning environments.

Eli was created during the COVID lockdown in 2021, our group primarily working online and from home.
