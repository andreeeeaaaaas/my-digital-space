Eli is a physical device that promotes interactions within the online classroom by gamifying the experience. For our user– young students studying from home– eli lets them connect and interact a digital, non-disruptive way. 

In combination with an online teacher portal with engagement metrics, Eli facilitates  support for students suffering from feelings of isolation and disconnectedness in remote learning environments.
