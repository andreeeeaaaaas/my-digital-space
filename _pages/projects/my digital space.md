<p class="callout">A self-built and hosted website to hold the things I like to build, create, and share.</p>

After endlessly tweaking my no-code portfolio site to a point where I was ready to release, I was hit with a huge, unexpected charge (in USD to make it sting a bit more). I knew that the site was  something that would go through periods of intense re-design, yet also downtimes where I might not touch it for months. With this in mind, it made no sense to be paying a monthly (exorbitant) fee.

This site serves as a free (other than the domain) and open-sourced method in which I can share and meditate on what I want out there in the world. It feels different than working on a no-code tool, as it feels *uniquely representative of me*.

If you're interested in replicating something like this, you can learn [[What's a digital space?|what a digital space  is]], or dive into the tech stack below. You can also view the open-sourced code repository on Github [here](https://github.com/andreeeeaaaaas/my-digital-space).
