<p class="callout">A self-built and hosted website to hold the things I like to build, create, and share.</p>

This site serves as a free (other than the domain) and open-sourced method in which I can share and meditate on what I want out there in the world.

I've built a few custom plug-ins that it utilises, but try keep things simplistic.

If you're interested in replicating something like this, you can learn [[What's a digital space?|what a digital space  is]], or dive into the tech stack below. You can also view the open-sourced code repository on Github [here](https://github.com/andreeeeaaaaas/my-digital-space).

Better yet, [[contact|shoot me an email and ask!]]
