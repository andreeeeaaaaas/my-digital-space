<p class="callout">A self-built and published website to hold the things I like to build, create, and share</p>

Portfolio websites go out of date almost immediately. 

They are updated sporadically; often when looking for another opportunity. The 'no-code', 'low-effort' platforms people tend to use however, charge consistently and expensively.

This space serves as a **free**– other than the domain– **and open-sourced** method in which I can consistently and easily share what I want out there in the world. Like a good product or service, it can grow and flex with its primary user over time. 

That primary user being– me.

I've built a few custom plug-ins that it utilises, but try keep things simplistic and future-proof. The aim of the site is longevity, and flexibility. I don't know what content will look like in 5 years, and I know much less about what I'll be interested in by then... *maybe furniture design*...

If you're interested in replicating something like this, you can learn [[What's a digital space?|what a digital space  is]], or dive into the tech stack below. You can also view the open-sourced code repository on Github [here](https://github.com/andreeeeaaaaas/my-digital-space).
