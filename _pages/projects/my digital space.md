<p class="callout">A self-built and published space to hold the things I like to build, create, and share</p>

My digital space is inspired by similar spaces like [Andy Matuschak's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), and how I structure my thoughts in the tool I use everyday [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It extends that idea to my work and creative output, seeing them as building blocks to learn and iterate off in the next project, rather than standalone pieces.

While it simplifies some of the connections I've built between them and doesn't it hold all the notes I jot down, it aims to get across how I link things together in order to come to the next 'thing'. It stands by the notion that nothing is ever finished.

The hope isâ€“like a good product or serviceâ€“it can grow and flex with its primary user over time: Me ðŸ˜Ž

**It's also free and open sourced.**
## Build

Creating this space has been a rewarding practice of basic front-end development while keeping design principles at the core.

I've built a few custom Ruby plug-ins that it utilises, but try keep things simplistic and future-proof. The aim of the site is longevity, and flexibility. I don't know what content will look like in 5 years, and I know much less about what I'll be interested in by then...

If you're interested in replicating something like this, you can learn [[What's a digital space?|what a digital space  is]], or dive into the tech stack below. You can also view the open-sourced code repository on Github [here](https://github.com/andreeeeaaaaas/my-digital-space).
