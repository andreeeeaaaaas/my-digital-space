You are currently in my digital space. 

It's inspired by similar spaces like [Andy Matuschak's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), and how I structure my thoughts in the tool I use everyday [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

It sees my work and creative output as building blocks to learn and iterate off in the next project, rather than standalone pieces.

<!-- While it simplifies some of the connections I've built between them and doesn't hold all the notes I jot down, it aims to get across how I link things together in order to come to the next 'thing'. It stands by the notion that nothing is ever finished. -->

The hope isâ€“like a good product or serviceâ€“it can grow and flex with its primary user over time. That primary user being me ðŸ˜Ž

**It's also free and open sourced.**
## Build

Creating this space has been a rewarding practice of basic front-end development while keeping design principles at the core.

I've built a few custom plug-ins and scripts that it utilises, but try keep things simplistic and future-proof. The aim of the site is longevity, and flexibility; I don't know what content will look like in 5 years, and I know much less about what might interest me by then.
