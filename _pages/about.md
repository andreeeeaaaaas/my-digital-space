> Aspiring disciplinary polygot, one skill at a time

I'm Andreas ðŸ‘‹ a **designer**, **thinker**, and **tinkerer**. I love solving complex problems with deeply-researched, strategic, and delightful solutions. 

My spare time is filled with things like:
- being in the ocean
- endeavouring to become *~~bilingual~~* tri-lingual (Â¡Hola! or Î¥Î¹Î±ÏƒÎ¿Ï…!)
- playing with [[Ziggy]]
- making strange music with [[An overly complicated system|overly complicated systems]]
- or trying some new thing that's taken my fancy

## Experience
Currently taking part in the NSW Government graduate program as a digital graduate, my learning has been wide-ranging and insightful.

Prior to now, I have:
- taught [Interactive Product Design](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/DECO3200) at the University of Sydney,
- taught [Qualitative Research](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/DECO2019) at the University of Sydney
- designed educational material for the not-for-profit education startup [Consent Labs](https://www.consentlabs.org.au/)
- lead and co-directed an out of hours school care (*great fun, terribly exhausting*)
