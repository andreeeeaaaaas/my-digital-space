<div class="callout">I'm Andreas ðŸ‘‹ â€“ I make things for people to use, hear, and see</div>

My design work solves complex product and service challenges through deep-research, strategic thinking, and considered experimentation. Beginning with understanding each element in a context and system â†’ resulting in work that feels intuitive and refined.

<!-- As a creator, I aim to explore complex emotions and ideas through experiential mediums like music, film, and more. I want to investigate the human experience (both that of others, and my own), creating space for reflection. -->

Whether it's a product or a service; a collection of music or a short film; I value commitment to thoughtful experimentation that guides towards a clear purpose. 

**The resultâ€“ I hopeâ€“ is work that communicates with immediacy while inviting deeper engagement.**

My spare time is filled with things like:
- being in the ocean
- endeavouring to become *~~bilingual~~* tri-lingual (Â¡Hola! or Î¥Î¹Î±ÏƒÎ¿Ï…!)
- playing with [[Ziggy]]
- making strange music with [[An overly complex system|overly complicated systems]]
- or trying some new thing that's taken my fancy

## Experience
Currently taking part in the NSW Government graduate program as a digital graduate, my learning has been wide-ranging and insightful.

Prior to now, I have:

- taught [Interactive Product Design](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/DECO3200) at the University of Sydney,
- taught [Qualitative Research](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/DECO2019) at the University of Sydney
- designed educational material for the not-for-profit education startup [Consent Labs](https://www.consentlabs.org.au/)
- lead and co-directed an out of hours school care (*great fun, terribly exhausting*)
