> Aspiring creative polygotâ€“ one new skill at a time

I'm Andreas ðŸ‘‹ â€“ a designer and creator focused on thoughtful simplicity.

My design work solves complex challenges through deep-research, strategic thinking, and considered experimentation; bringing creativity to the forefront. Beginning with understanding each element within it's context and system; resulting in work that feels intuitive and refined.

As a creator, I aim to explore complex emotions and ideas through experiential mediums like music, film, and more. I want to investigate the human experience (both my that of others, and my own), creating space for reflection.

Whether it's a product or a service; a collection of music or a short film; I value commitment to thoughtful experimentation that guides towards a clear purpose. 

The resultâ€“ I hopeâ€“ is work that communicates with immediacy while inviting deeper engagement.

My spare time is filled with things like:
- being in the ocean
- endeavouring to become *~~bilingual~~* tri-lingual (Â¡Hola! or Î¥Î¹Î±ÏƒÎ¿Ï…!)
- playing with [[Ziggy]]
- making strange music with [[An overly complex system|overly complicated systems]]
- or trying some new thing that's taken my fancy
