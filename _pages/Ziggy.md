<p class= "caption">The bestest boy in the whole world.</p>
Some of his best qualities include:
- Catches balls and other things you throw towards him
- Fetches
- Perpetually smiling (may be sweating)
- Loves playing with other dogs
- Friendly to creatures young and old, great and small

Some of his more challenging qualities include:
- Fetches (does not return)
- Sand can become trapped in his fur, then slowly shed over time all over the floor
- Will pester other dogs into chasing him
- There's probably more, but I actually look past them all anyway...
