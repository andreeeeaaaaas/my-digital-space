<p class="intro">My 4 year old, perpetually smiling, slightly overweight, Finnish-Lapphund son</p>

<p class="figcaption">The bestest boy in the whole world.</p>

Some of his best qualities include:
- Fetches
- Perpetually smiling (may be sweating)
- Loves playing with other dogs
- Friendly to creatures young and old, great and small

Some of his more challenging qualities include:
- Fetches (does not return)
- Sand gets trapped in his fur, then slowly sheds over time all over the floor
- Will pester other dogs into chasing him
- There's probably more, but I actually look past them all anyway...
